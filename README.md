## Data sources

Currently, ChartBrew supports connections to these data sources.

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB
* APIs that support JSON data

## Prerequisites

* NodeJS v12 (should also work with v10)
* NPM
* MySQL v5+ Server running and an empty database to use for Chartbrew

## Start

It is recommended you head over to the more detailed documentation to find out how to set up Chartbrew

[üìö You can find it here](https://docs.chartbrew.com/#getting-started)

## Quickstart

If you already have a MySQL server running, create a database called `chartbrew` and adjust the parameters below with your connection settings. The command will then setup everything for you.

**Important** Windows command line is not supported at the moment. Use something like [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) on Windows.

```sh
npx create-chartbrew-app chartbrew
```

The CLI tool creates a `chartbrew/.env` file which you can configure at any time if you want to change the database, API & client host, etc. The file contains comments explaining what each environmental variable is for. [Check out which need to be set here.](https://docs.chartbrew.com/#set-up-environmental-variables)

**Run the database migrations**

If the database parameters are correct, the migrations should run automatically. If the new database wasn't populated with tables, ensure all the environmental variables are set, then run the following command in the `server` folder:

```sh
cd server
npm run db:migrate
```

### Run the project in Development

Open two terminals, one for front-end and the other for back-end.

```sh
# frontend
cd client/
npm run start

# backend
cd server/
npm run start-dev
```

## Run with Docker

[Check the full guide in the docs.](https://docs.chartbrew.com/deployment/#run-the-application-with-docker)

### Quickstart

Run the following commands and configure the variables:

```sh
docker pull razvanilin/chartbrew
```

```sh
docker run -p 3210:3210 -p 3000:3000 \
  -e CB_SECRET=<enter_a_secure_string> \
  -e CB_API_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e CB_DB_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -e CB_DB_NAME=chartbrew \
  -e CB_DB_USERNAME=root \
  -e CB_DB_PASSWORD=password \
  -e REACT_APP_CLIENT_HOST=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e REACT_APP_API_HOST=http://localhost:3210 \
  razvanilin/chartbrew
```
